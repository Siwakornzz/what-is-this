# Protocol: Error Handling

## Purpose
To establish a consistent and user-friendly approach to error management across the application.

## Guidelines
1.  **User-Friendly Messages:** Display clear, concise, and actionable error messages to the user. Avoid exposing raw technical errors.
2.  **Centralized Logging:** Implement a centralized logging mechanism for all errors. Log sufficient context (e.g., user ID, request details, stack trace) for debugging purposes.
3.  **Graceful Degradation:** Design components to degrade gracefully when errors occur, rather than crashing the entire application.
4.  **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement appropriate retry logic for transient network or API errors where applicable.
5.  **Error Boundaries:** Utilize React Error Boundaries for catching JavaScript errors in component trees and displaying fallback UIs.
6.  **API Error Mapping:** Map generic API error responses to specific, understandable application errors.
